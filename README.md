### Hi there 👋
  <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/SWoSkN6DxTszqIKEqv/giphy.gif" alt="Coder GIF" >
My name is Srushith Repakula. I'm Head of Engineering at [KonfHub](https://konfhub.com/), a one-stop platform for technical conferences built on AWS stack, primarily using serverless and other associated services.

I got my first taste of serverless while participating in the "AWS Chatbot Challenge" –  where I fell instantly in love with the technology and the unparalleled passion for Lambdas henceforth began.
